I have increased the output power now. I am in QRO position which means "full volume" of soundcard. IMDAs for the IMD you have to read it by "eyes" by looking at waterfall HI HI.

Your trace in the correloscope is a little bit slanted toward right side, I think because oft the small unalignment between soundcards.

Yes it is a very bad thing becaus ee means that th e two soundcards clocks are running at different rates.

All 100% copied,. Signal is weak but no great problems ion my side. I see your trace on the correloscope is slanted toward rleft side, you should see the same thing but on the opposite side I think. Such slanting uisis due to soundcard clocks running at diffreerent rates.

It's strange that on the fast computer it doesn't work. We have to investigate bvetter what is the problem. The progranm needs a full duplex soundcard working at 44100 16 bit mono.... any card sohould do this.

fine copy here. As regards the frequency 1500 is ok from my side I only had to pmove the IF passband filyeter of my old TS140-S.

As regards the default values, Chris y you might want to increase the oversample factor to 7 or 21 if your CPU is fast enough, because with more oversampling points thre iere is bettere accuracy.

Yes ok, let's stay here in this channel. BTW in the program you are running there is a BUG in the AFC system, in tyhhe sense that it will always work even if it's unturned HI.

As regards the slanting there is now way right now to fix it. The oversample is only to improve the quality not for slanting. 
Anyway I think you should not workkry much beacause your salanting is torelarlerable. In the future we'll aldd all the otools for making it the more precise possible.

Please note how the trace gets whiither when afc sets to the rigtht frequency too.

As regards slanting, in this Spread Spectrum mode it is needed a superior accuracy from the soundcard. This is the reason you snow see the slanting and why you don't see it in sstv or orther systems. As regards the graphic driver I think you are correct. I halsoalso have another PC (faster) which has built-in viodedeo card and runs very slow in the graphic.

Yes you did duplex transmissio n HI. The nice thing was seeing the two traces on the correloscope at the same time, and of course the decoder program was jumopping from one to totthe other trying to print the text HI HI.

Chris you should try with fewer colords, e.g. 16 bit colors wich hich are faster to draw on the screen and the quality is almost unnoticeable by true colors.

ok well the spctrums look we tee from both as its fine and its depending on the trasnceiver system i have spctrum lab analyser here running as well and all is fine from the program nino no problem it symetrical but what i am more interested is to get the program under comntropl in order to install all in different systems if we once want to get it open hi so again i check the graphic card behaving nino but you should loook odthat is t$kiz9 all settings if possible as the insP,aOnaware hoe to adjsut card and c iayaGkxnnt as i htete sekn a sa goes with iryd cards as i have seen on the mixw program 2 or 3 momth agao when iw as invastigating new  soundchopis on regular intel systems hi which are also on laptops btu nino de hb9bdm pse k 
trrrrr
Not everything copied because signal is getting weaker. Yes we have to make it work under as many as different system as possible. At work I have also various PCs to thest. I have done a great effort by writing the program as fast as possible, by using assembler code in the correlator, because at start it only worked with 1.5 Ghz and superior CPUs. 

Another sissue will be making the users produce a good signal with no IMD. It's very easy to iproduce interference att 300 Baud PSK. BTW I see that there is a proliferation of PSK modes by simply multiplying PSK31, one t, two , three or 4 times.... this is very silly for me HI HI.

btu fred de nino pkse KKK oh/dk4zcr ok, no more proposals except to make 1500 ˇ¥e standard as then we have 1000 hz to BOTH sides yand it will fit in the SSB f√ilter..
Also would like ttest thid under fading conds, maybe I will make a proposal abt it but first have to think, hi... Fiirst thinking than doind..
btu Chriis..H!hb9bdm
ok well i have very weak signal from nino and still had 70% copy here so its exellent even under wors condx better then mt63 nino ..
ok ok on the systme we have to look that it vcan  work and be installed on as many systems as possible otherwise you have a flood of request from the americans hi hi hi...
as you can read on any refelctor ok i habe specific questions and i shall call you on telefon later  and we can talk about it it is that ok and tell your mother i am calling hi btu ninio iz8bly de hb9bdm pse k 
7rrrrr
rrrr
Ok Chris, but you make the wrong assumption that I am able to SPEAK englishsh because I can WRITE it hi ... no really my english is very rusted as I don't talk it since years from now so there will be great understanding problems :-) maybe is better via email to give me chance to have a dictionary on my side :-)

As regards the performances of this mode, I see it is voworking even in bad condx. It will be interesting to compare with MT63. I have noticed that in "flutter" and "doppler" is better chip64 but in CCIIR poor oris better MT63. I have checked this with a ionospehhrieric path simulator (MoeÏ's PathSim).

What we need now is to reduce the typing speed a little bit (itÏs's quite fast now) and afdd FEC with interleaving covering 2 or more senconds so that fading will not afferct the reception.

Btu fred de nino pse KKK teTt oh/dktw
o, , yes we must compare this mode with mt63 and then we will see. I hope we will have soovaetter conds to VK or any other DX, maybe Chrusis has better tonds to US than me and you would like to compare ... but in US nobody has izt, hi... sorry I was thinking ahaed. But meybe someone whho is nar to another stn and opiexs via ground waves.. Thst would be the solution I think, Aloso thats only your job to make interleave and FEC and I can  do nothing this way, Nino. Do you know or accept another stn which will send fluttery sigas??
btu Chris.
ˇ¶hb9bdm
ok first nino you speak always a understanable english no worrry 
ok on the subject to test when i have the systems working fine on all my systems which is first theen i can simulate all the condx here as i can send into a dummy and receive on a second receiver and simulat all tzhe noise and flutter withe a open second rx which has all the noise and qrm from air  so i can see a lot her without going outside i have done taht also withe pter when we started amotor the also on psk31 in the beginning .. its great hi.. but as said first nino i have noticed the to fast speed as i see loosing letters when fading comes up and you typed fast 
and the also pls make a adjustment for the soundcard if its possible a lot of wishes and i shall inbvastigate the behaving of graphic cards hope you still copy nino fred is perefct and bntu nino 
n mrrrrr
rrrr
Ok 100%
As regards simulations, you can use PathSim which can simulate evrery environment,m and you don't even need two computer s i f you rin un WindowsXP, you just have the two programs running (Pathsim transmitting and Chip764 receiveiing).

As regards the speed it is a bit fast. Notice in the lower-left corner of the screen the "RX*-Idle" when I aham writing. The rate now is 38 bit per secodnnd, and with a very light FEC we can go down to 28 bits per seconds (fec would BEbe R=3/4 and K=9). Also a light interleaver will help in fading because now a little fading can disrupt the text.

BTW, if you look at the correloscope, the peak is the perfect reflection of the state of ionosphere reflections... it is very interesting aspect to study.

Fred btu de Nino please KKK Ih~FFta oh/dk4zcnot much Nino, only the end as dk0mun wanted to open ?tmailbox heree. I was thinking th we need a fluttery signal or suffering by phasehifting and   NOT  a pa yrfect signal which come from the next table and qrm it with a fluttery signal, vy interesting that uit is the same and so all can de done  Din the shack, Chri its seems to be your job. But Nino, would you accept another tn for on-air syignal texstytinmgs?
btu Chris.

well i can simulate a lot here en across the table hi as its all done on air not via cable but again i would mlike to have the program setup first so  we have some problems fixed t'wot mixing up progteh problems Pe others .. well so far i am very happy and i dont think its a to good idea to have in the beginning to many stations  and he should havs esame basic computer knowledge hi  well nino i have a very good takeoff to murray and can make some arrangement as zl comes in here very good and under this mode condx which i have seen now i am sure i can make it well to him as the t zl beacon comes in fine btu nino and other hints concerning installatuon 
btu de hb9bdm  and als the f12 button needs some delay hi Rei‰hrrrr

Ok 100% copied. To reply Fered's question, yes we can accept one or two more stations I think. We need someone in the U.S. and someone in Japan too. I was also thinking of VK2DSG but of course there are many names that comes in my mind.

I need also some time to work at the program. I have a to-do list that has many items. From, from FEC to a better filtering. The problem with Murray is that he has a slow PC so the program runs only at oversamlple=1, so I gavhave to improve the speed too. There is lot of work to do. What I expect is the mode to perform better than all the traditional modes (PSK31, MFSK16, MT63) in the waek condition. As a spread spectrum mode it is performing very bad. For example they say that nin spread spectrum namanuyy station cas can stay in the same frequency but obviously this isn't true twith this sisyystem. Maybe the callaim about spread spectrum is a little bit exaggerated HI HI.

btu fred de nino pse K IFtagFIoh/dk4zcok, yes, its your decision only whom to involve and when you need somebody or some conditions pse tell me. I am stadnndby only waiting for yout r requests.
Yiour sig is no more seen and heard Nino and I was still copying, but then a tuner came on freq abt 500 hz below your signal and the AFC went to that signal.. The freq has to be free to copy under so poor conds which we have at monm. I thing its all I can do for the mom and would like to get instructions what to do and what not, I am with the reflector and my e-mail is also known. so witill thank both of you for the vy intinerseting experiment and see you tomorrow same time. btu Chris.

tR  ªne well i hope nino is still copin“ºme ok nino i tzake the job to check installations here as i have 4 sdtssttz{ differentspeeds of cpus and alsi different chipsets intel via etc and if we cann setyR i p  RtΩotet bsl bVhabngt  t  Z iItRUr cozeteitywt i ht  h

All OK friends, let's continue tomorrow the experimentation. I hope to find MUrurray too, hoping to have good condx for ZL. I will also write some comments on the reflector and of course I'Úll work a bit on the program and if any significant enhancement I'll post a new version to check on-air.

My best 73 see you otomorrow.
